# Lake chlorophyll-a and suspended particulate estimates from VIIRS measurments

### About
This repository contains source code for the following papers:

- <i>["Cao et al., (2021), to be submitted. </i>

### Usage
This repository is used to retrieve the chlorophyll-a and SPM concentration from VIIRS Rayleigh-corrected reflectance, which can be produced by SeaDAS.

### Description for this algorithm
Current performance is shown in the following scatter plots, with 70% of the data used for training and 30% for testing.
**Models supplied in this repository are trained using 100% of the dataset** for a potential improvement in other regions, and so observed performance may differ slightly.

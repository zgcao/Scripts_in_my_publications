# SPM estimates from MODIS surface reflectance data

### About
This repository contains source code for the following papers:

- <i>["Cao et al., (2022), What water color parameters could be mapped using MODIS land reflectance products: A global evaluation over coastal and inland waters, Earth-Science Reviews, 232, 104154. 10.1016/j.earscirev.2022.104154"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0012825222002380)</i>

### Usage
This repository is used to retrieve the SPM and chlorophyll-a concentration from MODIS surface reflectance data. The xgboost model can be robust for SPM retrievals yet the chl-a model does not work well.


I am prepraing a easy-use script to use these models for retrieving SPM from MODIS reflectance, and will release soon.


Please let me know if you have any concerns.
